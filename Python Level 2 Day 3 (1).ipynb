    "# What is Unit testing?\n",
    "A unit test is a way of testing a unit - the smallest piece of code that can be logically isolated in a system. In most programming languages, that is a function, a subroutine, a method or property. The isolated part of the definition is important. In his book \"Working Effectively with Legacy Code\", author Michael Feathers states that such tests are not unit tests when they rely on external systems: “If it talks to the database, it talks across the network, it touches the file system, it requires system configuration, or it can't be run at the same time as any other test.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex: During the process of manufacturing a ballpoint pen, the cap, the body, the tail and clip, the ink cartridge and the ballpoint are produced separately and unit tested separately. Each piece is a different part of the pen, but all individuall made and test by themselves to see if they work alone. "

    "# What does Unit testing look like?\n",
    "A unit can be almost anything you want it to be -- a line of code, a method, or a class. Generally though, smaller is better. Smaller tests give you a much more granular view of how your code is performing. There is also the practical aspect that when you test very small units, your tests can be run fast; like a thousand tests in a second fast."

    "# Who should create the Unit tests?\n",
    "In his book, Real Time Business Systems, Robert V. Head says \"Frequently, unit testing is considered part of the programming phase, with the person that wrote the program...unit testing\". That isn't because programmers hold the secret sauce to unit testing, it's because it makes sense. The programmer that wrote the prod code will likely know how to access the parts that can be tested easily and how to mock objects that can't be accessed otherwise. It's a time trade off."

    "# Test Driven Development\n",
    "Test Driven Development, or TDD, is a code design technique where the programmer writes a test before any production code, and then writes the code that will make that test pass. The idea is that with a tiny bit of assurance from that initial test, the programmer can feel free to refactor and refactor some more to get the cleanest code they know how to write. The idea is simple, but like most simple things, the execution is hard. TDD requires a completely different mind set from what most people are used to and the tenacity to deal with a learning curve that may slow you down at first."

    "# Code Documentation\n",
    "Code documentation is a drag, and it shows, mostly by how little code documentation gets written. Unit testing can make the documentation burden a little easier by encouraging better coding practices and also leaving behind pieces of code that describe what your product is doing. Rather than having to constantly feed the documentation beast with code change, you'll be updating a system of checks that is working for you."
